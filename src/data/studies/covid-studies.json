    "Other Information": "Access to ORCHID data requires data access approvals from the NLM Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) system. ORCHID data is also available to those with appropriate access permission on BioLINCC (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_orchid/), where they may download the data. Researchers using ORCHID data may find helpful the reproducible code originally used by the ORCHID research team to arrive at their results. It is available in BioData Catalyst Powered by PIC-SURE, for which there is more information in a Jupyter notebook (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/blob/master/NHLBI_BioData_Catalyst/R/ORCHID_COVID19.ipynb). Visit https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/blob/master/NHLBI_BioData_Catalyst/R/ORCHID_COVID19.ipynb to access the repository in which the ORCHID clinical trial analysis is reproduced."
