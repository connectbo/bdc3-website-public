    Investigation of the Impact of Structural Variation on the Genetic Etiology of Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Traits
bio: >
    Dr. Harrison Brandâ€™s scientific career has included a diverse set of research pursuits that have reflected a natural evolution towards his ultimate goal of understanding how genetic variation contributes to complex disease.
    After completion of his PhD in Human Genetics, he accepted a postdoc position in the lab of Dr. Michael Talkowski at the Center for Genomic Medicine at MGH investigating the impact of structural variation (SV) on developmental disorders.
    Upon completion of his postdoc, Dr. Brand accepted a junior faculty position in the Department of Neurology at MGH, where he continues to evaluate the impact of SV on disease.
