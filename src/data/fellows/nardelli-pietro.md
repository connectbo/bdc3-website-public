abstract: CT-Based Pulmonary Hypertension Phenotyping in Smokers Using Artificial Intelligence 
bio: Pietro Nardelli holds a PhD in Electric and Electronic Engineering received from the University College Cork, Ireland, where he was the original developer and designer of an innovative open source approach for virtual bronchoscopy starting from CT images. Since 2016, he has been a member of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and an instructor in Radiology at Harvard Medical School. Nardelli has a broad background in biomedical engineering, with specific training and expertise in medical image analysis and artificial intelligence applied to medicine. The goal of his research program is the design and development of new algorithms in the field of image-based biomarkers for the understanding of lung diseases, with particular interest in Pulmonary Vascular Disease (PVD). As part of his research, Dr. Nardelli is leading several artificial intelligence projects at the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory (ACIL), where he develops and applies new machine learning approaches for advanced image-based lung phenotyping problems. He also contributes at the development, integration, and validation of new algorithms into the open-source software platform, the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP) and he is member of the COPDGene imaging core group.
