bio: After studying mathematics and physics in preparation for the Concours des Grandes Ecoles and earning an engineering diploma in bioinformatics from the ENSIMAG (Grenoble, France), Jean Malong spent two years in Barcelona as an exchange student. During this time, he looked for splicing-QTLs in Dr. Roderic Guigo's group at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain. Malong then completed his PhD with Dr. Guillaume Bourque at McGill University (Montreal, Canada) where he studied copy-number variation in large human cohorts. He is now a postdoctoral researcher in the University of California, Santa Cruz working on variation graph and structural variation in the lab of Dr. Benedict Paten.
