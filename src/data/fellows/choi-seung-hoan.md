bio: >
    Seung Hoan Choi is a postdoctoral associate in the laboratory of Dr. Patrick Ellinor in the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute. He received a PhD from the Department of Biostatistics at Boston University with his focused research in statistical genetics. His long-term interests are developing and applying novel statistical methods to elucidate the genetic basis of complex diseases. He has been working on developing his analytic capabilities in genetics, statistics, and large-scale data processing. During his postdoctoral training, he has used this foundation to elucidate the genetic basis of a common and complex human disease, atrial fibrillation.
