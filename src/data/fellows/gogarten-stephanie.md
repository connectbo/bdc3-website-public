bio: Stephanie Gogartenâ€™s educational background is in astrophysics, but while completing her PhD, she discovered a true passion in developing scientific software and grappling with the complexities of massive datasets. For the past 10 years she has been a member of the Genetic Analysis Center housed in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, developing R/Bioconductor packages and python-based pipelines focused on phenotype-genotype association testing, initially for SNP arrays and then moving into whole genome sequencing. Her team is currently the Data Coordinating Center for TOPMed.
