abstract: Association Study of Iron Overload in Sickle Cell Disease Population Using NHLBI WGS from TOPMed
bio: Fayuan Wen has over 10 years of research experience in cellular and molecular biology with a specific training and expertise in bioinformatics data analysis for next-generation sequencing (NGS) including RNA-seq and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). During her PhD study and post-doc training, I developed the methodology and performed bioinformatics analysis of the proposed research in different areas, including whole genome sequencing analysis of sickle cell disease and host and virus interaction and cells’ transcriptional response to chemical treatment. Wen’s current research focuses on identifying novel genetic markers of iron overload in sickle cell disease patients in the TOPMed WGS project.
