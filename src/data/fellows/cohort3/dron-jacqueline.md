    title: Modeling lifetime coronary artery disease trajectories of naturally occurring DNA variation linked to low circulating triglycerides
    abstract: >
        Circulating triglyceride (fat) concentrations are an important and causal driver of coronary artery disease, which is rising globally in step with the obesity epidemic. Our team has led efforts to identify individuals with inborn protection from high triglyceride levels via a single DNA mutation of large-effect (monogenic) or the cumulative impact of many variants (polygenic). Here, I propose to model longitudinal trajectories of triglyceride concentrations and coronary artery disease according to these factors, using whole-genome sequencing data from 56,203 individuals across 13 TOPMed cohorts. Beyond the scientific innovation of this proposed work, and reflecting a deep commitment to the BioData Catalyst ecosystem and enabling rigorous research, I will build scalable and shareable analytic pipelines that will be generalizable to the genomics community.

    Jacqueline Dron is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Amit Khera's lab at the Center for Genomic Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Her research focuses on the integration of genetic data, electronic health records, and metabolomic data to better understand the molecular signatures of cardiometabolic diseases. She completed her PhD from Western University (London, Canada) in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Robert Hegele, where she studied the underlying genetic determinants of lipid disorders &ndash with an emphasis on hypertriglyceridemia &ndash in a specialized dyslipidemia cohort.
