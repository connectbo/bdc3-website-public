abstract: Identification and Characterization of Diet-Responsive Genetic Loci for Glycemic Traits 
bio: Kenny Westerman is a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute. He is interested in developing improved approaches to precision nutrition using genomic and bioinformatic methods. Westerman received his PhD in Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition from Tufts University and is now a part of the Manning Laboratory, where his work involves the development of software and cloud workflows for large-scale gene-environment interaction analysis. His current projects aim to apply these tools to uncover novel gene-diet interactions and develop molecular predictors of personalized response to diet.
