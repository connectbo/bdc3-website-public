- Use one of the microservices or community tools to submit data objects and metadata to a Gen3 Commons. Or develop your own tools specific to your user community. 
- Gen3 will automatically index your data and provide globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). GUIDs can also be resolved at dataguids.org to find out where a data object lives within your data ecosystem. 
- Engage Gen3’s broad user community. Ask a question, answer a question, request a new feature, or see if anyone else has approached a technical or scientific problem like yours in their Gen3 data commons. 
- Gen3’s UI includes a data exploration tool you can customize for your data. You can choose the queries or faceted searches your user community wants; decide whether the data is able to leave the cloud or not; or develop your own apps over Gen3 APIs. 
- Gen3 can be deployed with various levels of security and compliance. Deploy your data commons or ecosystem with the controls needed for your data and your user 
- You can leave your data open to the Internet or control access at deeper levels within your own data use ontology, from the core data to the data objects
