      <Paragraph>
        NHLBI's response to the public health threat posed by COVID-19 includes
        a <ExternalLink to="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/directors-messages/coronavirus-covid-19-nhlbi-response">multi-pronged research strategy</ExternalLink>,
        which includes translational research, clinical trials, clinical epidemiology, and population science.
        The NHLBI will also leverage its cyberinfrastructure, namely the BioData Catalyst ecosystem,
        to help coordinate various data management needs among many of the COVID-19 efforts.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
      BioData Catalyst is supporting data aggregation, rapid and broad access, and computation for NHLBI-funded COVID-19 datasets.
      In an effort to drive more impactful analyses, BioData Catalyst will be interoperable with other COVID-19 data resources.

      <Heading>Accessing ORCHID Trial Data</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        At this time, BioData Catalyst has available ORCHID (Outcomes Related to COVID-19 treated with Hydroxychloroquine among In-patients with symptomatic Disease) trial data.
        Access to ORCHID data requires data access approvals from the NLM Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes
        (<ExternalLink to="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login">dbGaP</ExternalLink>) system.
        ORCHID data is also available to those with appropriate access permission
        on <ExternalLink to="https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_orchid/ ">BioLINCC</ExternalLink>,
        where they may download the data. ORCHID and other hosted data on BioData Catalyst may not be downloaded
        (see the <ExternalLink to="https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/data-protection">BioData Catalyst Data Protection webpage</ExternalLink>).
