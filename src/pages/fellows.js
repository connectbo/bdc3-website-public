                The NHLBI BioData Catalyst Fellows Program provides researchers, especially early-career researchers,
                the opportunity to receive funding to support research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems.
                The program is open to academic disciplines conducting biomedical research or related research in heart, lung, blood, and sleep domains.
